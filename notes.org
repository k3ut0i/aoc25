* TODO Day01
** DONE Part1
- Took a while to get _io_ working.
- Used a _foldl2_, probably for the first time. I initially wrote a iterative function to traverse the list.

** TODO Part2
Couldn't get the correct answer. Making some mistake. I got 6392 first and 6287 next. The actual answer is b/w them.

* DONE Day05
- ~diet~ module which implements fat sets, made this simple.
- A simple fold for creation.
- Another for counting (filter+length).
- counting cardinality is even simpler.

* DONE Day06
- map2, foldl_corresponding.
- tranpose and split_when utility functions
